## Research Training
**[NIH Post-baccalaureate Intramural Training Award Research Fellow](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta)**\
Molecular Parasitology Section; Supervisor: Michael E. Grigg, PhD\
*NIH, NIAID, June 2019 - August 2021*
  - **Role of recombination in the emergence and *in situ* evolution of SARS-CoV-2**
    - Developing a bioinformatics pipeline with team to retrieve and analyze globally distributed whole genome sequences of human SARS-CoV-2 for evidence of recombination through molecular and phylogenetic analysis
    - Initiating partnership with team to acquire SARS-CoV-2 samples from the Metropolitan Maryland, Virginia, and DC corridor to identify origins, mutations, and recombination patterns circulating locally
  - **Novel Sarcocystis canis-variant infection in captive and free-ranging pinnipeds**
    - Analyzed sequence alignments and constructed phylogenetic trees of the evolutionary relationships facilitating the discovery of six distinct single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the ITS-1 marker, identifying a unique genetic signature of a novel Sarcocystis canis variant subspecies 
    - Wrote manuscript draft for peer-reviewed journal (publication in preparation)
  - **Disease transmission from wildlife to livestock in the Fraser River Valley of British Columbia, Canada**
    - Elucidating the transmission cycles of abortion-causing parasites, *Neospora caninum*, *Toxoplasma gondii*, and various *Sarcocystis spp*. to document incidence and economic impact in cattle, and coyotes’ role as a reservoir species
    - Independently completed extensive field work (British Columbia, Canada) acquiring cattle herd health data and specimens for diagnostic testing at NIH
    
**Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin - Madison**\
Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology; Supervisor: John Mansfield, PhD\
*Jan 2016 - August 2018*
  - Verifying differentially expressed genes between low and high virulence strains of African Trypanosomes using qPCR to confirm RNAseq studies
    - Optimized a sensitive quantitative PCR assay process to study the differential expression of genes at the transcriptional level in Trypanosomes
    - Assisted team in cattle vaccination experiments facilitating a now completed study of infected livestock in Morocco
    - Monitored the health of mouse colonies for immunological studies and assisted team in vaccination and challenge procedures in mice
    - Completed undergraduate research thesis and poster presentation
